You wanna?
You wanna?
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini? You better work, bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch! (ah-ah)
Now get to work, bitch! (ah-ah)
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Work it hard, like it's your profession
Watch out now, 'cause here it comes
Here comes the smasher, here comes the master
Here comes the big beat, big beat to blast ya
No time to quit now, just time to get it now
Pick up what I'm putting down, pick up what I'm putting down
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini? You better work, bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch! (ah-ah)
Now get to work, bitch! (ah-ah)
Break it off, break it down
See me come and you can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word, spread the word
